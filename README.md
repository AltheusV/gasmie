Gasmie, an acronym for Games Animes Series Movies Info Extractor, is a small personal project that I worked while I was learning web scrapping, files and API integration in dotnet.

The main purpose of this project is to fill some of my Notion personal pages, with extracted data from the following websites:

* [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com)
* [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com)

The webscrapping was necessary because currently, there is no public API for both of the websites.
